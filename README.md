# cluster algorithm

## Introdution

A python implemented for cluster. 

This is a basic engineering code, you can add or delete some content according to your own needs, so as to achieve the appearance you want.

For example, to increase the algorithm of cluster, you need to add python files in direction of algorithm;

## Directory

- ### ```data```
  The data set file, which contains data and labels.
  
  ```
  0.477288,0.928840,2
  ```
  
- ### ```algorithm```
  
  The algorithm of cluster.
  
- ### ```evaluation```
  
  The evaluation of cluster.
  
- ### ```utils```

  The utils function of algorithm.


- ### ```output```

  The log file in test process.

## Test

You should modify the main.py firstly, and then:

```python
python main.py
```
